# Nimble PHP
A lightweight PHP MVC framework

Nimble PHP strives to be a lightweight, simple to install and use MVC PHP development framework. While it is still in very early Alpha I wanted to get it online and begin some early testing. My goals for this project is to create a framework that is easier to install, use and configure while being more flexible and feature rich than any other framework available. This version will probably look nothing like the finished project but what the heck.
